remove global degeneracy between shifting all centers and shifting all PCAs

replace many flat vectors by ndarray's

subclass of ImagePsf
  should have routine to compute image, e.g.
    virtual void _computePsfImage(double *out, int nx, int ny, int x0, int y0, double x, double y, int icand)
  this routine can be used other places, e.g. to move xy optimization higher in the class hierarchy

move _optimize_pcas() higher in class hierarchy

oops, the _update*() methods should contain the class name for uniformity (e.g. _updatePcaBase())

scattered FIXMEs throughout code

fit_basis_images() should have an optional arg to output the best-fit linear combination of images (not just the coeffs)
this could be used to clean up in a few places, e.g. HscPcaPsfNoSM::_optimize_pca_coeffs_and_update()

when the HscCandidateSet is constructed, test whether SpatialCellCandidate is already marked BAD?

think about NeigenComponents=1 case more carefully!

spline and lanczos interpolation from afw::math

could get rid of class HscPcaPsfNoSM by including icand in spatial_model

do test with transposing in doComputeImage(), doComputeKernelImage()

get rid of hackery in chisqPsfDeterminer
  - configHack()
  - need to specify an outdir

FEATURES THAT MIGHT BE ADDED
  - build in distortion
  - intensity dependence
